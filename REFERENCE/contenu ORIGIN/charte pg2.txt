There is a world of hackdom out there. Please go out and explore it! By visiting hackerspaces and hacker conferences you will find geeks and nerds and dorks of like mind, enthusiastically teaching and sharing what they love. You in turn may find fulfillment in sharing and teaching what you love.
We all need community. And we all need to express ourselves through our creativity. This is how we survived as a species on our planet over many eons —supporting one another in community by learning and teaching and sharing what we know. We still need this! Hacker conferences and hackerspaces provide it!  This is what the worldwide hackerspace movement is all about: learning, teaching, and sharing what we love. We can hack anything! We are limited only by our imaginations, which, of course, are unlimited. What you hack is totally up to you: hardware, software, art, craft, science, food, music, society, the planet, and any number of various and sundry areas of possible interest, including your own life!
What is hacking? You may find this definition a convenient starting place: learning as much as you can about any realm that excites you, improving upon it, and sharing it. Don’t know what excites you yet? Exploring hackerspaces and hacker conferences may very well give you the clues you need!
Please spread the joy and pleasures and experiences of your life’s hacks. Learn and teach and share as you travel. Get stamps from as many hackerspaces and hacker conferences as you like. And cross-pollinate. We all know something others do not. And we can all learn from one another. And we can always learn more. As we learn, and teach and share, we all benefit. And through the support of the international hackerspace movement, you are making the world a better place merely by living the life you enjoy. So, please, go out into the world and enjoy! Explore what you love!
