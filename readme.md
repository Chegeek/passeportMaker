# Passport for the maker network. 

Project based on the passport hackerspace:
https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Passport

## At the beginning:
* promote people visiting as many hackerspaces around the world
* increase collaboration
* increase cross-pollination so we can all learn from one another
* encourage all hackerspaces to support each other
(And it's fun)

## next?
Like a certification about your skills, a pass to acces makerspace with the same membership
* This could be your CV
* this is your maker ID
* List all the skills
* List the time spent on tools
* List all your projects
* Contain your best cheat lists
* Could be a pocket lamp
* it grow with you
* Could embed RFID
* Automatic activation of tools via log rfid
* many more possibilities...
