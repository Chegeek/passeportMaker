# Passport for the maker network. 

Project based on the passport hackerspace:
https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Passport

## At the beginning:
* promote people visiting as many hackerspaces around the world
* increase collaboration
* increase cross-pollination so we can all learn from one another
* encourage all hackerspaces to support each other
(And it's fun)

## next?
Like a certification about your skills, a pass to acces makerspace with the same membership
* This could be your CV
* this is your maker ID
* List all the skills
* List the time spent on tools
* List all your projects
* Contain your best cheat lists
* Could be a pocket lamp
* it grow with you
* Could embed RFID
* Automatic activation of tools via log rfid
* many more possibilities... 

## Where i'm at now?
I start from this type of binding  
https://vimeo.com/81178782   
I spend some time to try to found the right way to use scribus to manage to have the right page order from printed A4 folded and cuted in a A6 booklet -> passeport.sla then passeport A4.sla is quite ok, I just print the pdf on recto/verso A4. 
But I would like to have a better fit for the layout and a bit resize it like a passport who is slightly smaller than A6. 
> Redimensionner format A6 (~15x10 cm) au format légal passeport un poil plus petit (8,8 par 12,5 cm) qui semble être un standard repris aussi pour les carnets moleskin, plus adapté à presque toutes les poches.

### passeport V2 cover
The cover is lasercutted and sew but the next one will be easier and binded with acounting screw, so it's easier to reorder and add some pages when needed.

Still need work on the inside layout for pages. For stamp, for the use of it... well it still need a lot of work.
